* 飞鸟戏荷滴水下，
    
* 鸭潜浮水风拂。
    
* 鸣蝉聒人片叶落，
    
* 绿草丛青。
    
* 喜樟叶少红，
    
* 淡香。
    
* 细雨慢停，
    
* 滴水岩滴。

* Birds flutter over lotus, droplets fall,
    
* Ducks dive and surface, as breezes call.
    
* Cicadas buzz, vexing to the ear, as leaves descend,
    
* Lush green grass, verdant.
    
* Camphor leaves with hints of red, joyous,
    
* A faint fragrance.
    
* Drizzle slowly ceases,
    
* Droplets, linger on rock.
