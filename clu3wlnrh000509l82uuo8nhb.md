* 在布满嗜血玫瑰的征程路上，
    
* 迷蒙云团向黑暗靠拢，
    
* 冥界的大门敞开……
    
* “四野茫然，你枉为权力的操纵者”，
    
* 来自地狱深处的呼喊，
    
* 马修利斯——
    
* 国王生前最为信任的引导者、善言人，
    
* 忠诚的骑士！

* On the journey full of bloodthirsty roses,
    
* The misty clouds move closer to the darkness,
    
* And the door to the underworld opens…
    
* “Looking around blankly, you are a manipulator of power in vain”,
    
* The cry from depths of hell,
    
* Matthew Lis –
    
* The king’s most trusted guide, good talker,
    
* And loyal knight during his lifetime!

* 你逝去的父亲，
    
* 我们曾数次并肩战斗于地狱、死亡之间，
    
* 信念让我苟活了下来……
    
* “王子啊，请直面、看清所要解决的问题，
    
* 哪怕胜利微乎其微”，
    
* 为了王国人民，
    
* 迎回光明，瓦解黑暗势力。
    
* 新的力量便要崛起！

* Your deceased father,
    
* We have fought side by side in hell and death several times,
    
* Faith has kept me alive…
    
* “Prince, please face and see clearly the problem to be solved,
    
* Even if the victory is very small”,
    
* For the people of the kingdom,
    
* Welcome back light and disintegrate the dark forces.
    
* A new power is about to rise!
