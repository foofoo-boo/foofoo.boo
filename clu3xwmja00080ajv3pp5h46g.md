量子灵学是一个术语，指的是一套试图将意识、智慧、灵性或神秘的世界观与量子力学及其解释联系起来的形而上学信仰和实践。有些人认为，量子物理可以揭示真实的现实和人类心灵在创造或影响现实中的作用。量子灵学经常受到科学家和怀疑者的批评，认为它是伪科学或骗局。

* Quantum spirituality is a term that refers to a set of metaphysical beliefs and practices that try to connect consciousness, intelligence, spirituality, or mystical worldviews to the ideas of quantum mechanics and its interpretations. Some people believe that quantum physics can reveal the true nature of reality and the role of the human mind in creating or influencing it. Quantum spirituality is often criticized by scientists and skeptics as pseudoscience or quackery.
    

量子灵学不是一个统一或连贯的思想体系，而是一个多样化和折衷的思想集合，它从各种来源汲取灵感，如东方神秘主义、新时代哲学、古代智慧传统和现代科学。有些人可能觉得量子灵学有吸引力或鼓舞人心，而有些人可能觉得它令人困惑或误导。量子灵学不是科学探究或理性思维的替代品，而是个人对自己的信念和经验的探索。

* Quantum spirituality is not a unified or coherent system of thought, but rather a diverse and eclectic collection of ideas that draw inspiration from various sources, such as Eastern mysticism, New Age philosophy, ancient wisdom traditions, and modern science. Some people may find quantum spirituality appealing or inspiring, while others may find it confusing or misleading. Quantum spirituality is not a substitute for scientific inquiry or rational thinking, but rather a personal exploration of one’s own beliefs and experiences.
